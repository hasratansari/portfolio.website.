A "Contact Me" section on a portfolio website is created using HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it. HTML elements like &lt;section>, &lt;h2>, &lt;p>, and &lt;a> are used to display headings, messages, and email links. CSS is applied to control layout, colors, fonts, and buttonsâ€”making the section visually appealing and user-friendly.
